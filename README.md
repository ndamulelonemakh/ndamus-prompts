# 🤖 Ndamu’s Public AI Prompts

> "Prompts are the new code.” – probably someone on Twitter

Welcome to my personal vault of AI prompts! This is where I keep the magic spells I use to bend AI models to my will — for coding, creating, thinking, and occasionally just having fun.

## 📦 What’s Inside

A growing collection of well-tested prompts I use daily across various AI tools and environments:

-	✨ nextjs-vibe-coding/ – Prompts to give your Next.js apps that extra shine.
-	🤖 jules-async-agent/ – Prompts that power my experimental asynchronous agent, Jules.
-	🧠 copilot-instructions/ – Copilot prompt snippets and custom instruction sets that actually work.

## 🧪 Experimental & Evolving

This repo is living. I tweak prompts often, and many are still experimental. Expect everything from enterprise-grade task automation to wild ideas that only make sense at 2AM.
