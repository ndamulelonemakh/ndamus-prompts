## Project understanding

```markdown
After carefully reading an understanding existing code(see README.md, copilot-instructions.md and docs/) Please develop the following features, using reliable sources to ensure correctness and leaving the project in working state(iteratively run bun run build or bun run type-check to ensure this). 
Always consider similar features already implemented to increase chance of success.
```
